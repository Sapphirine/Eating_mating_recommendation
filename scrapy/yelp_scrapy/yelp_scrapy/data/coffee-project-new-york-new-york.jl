(the latte was solid, just the espresso shot a bit too acidic for my taste) I'm not sure, but I was a bit disappointed despite the perfect latte and the ever so helpful barista who patiently explained how to best enjoy this process.\n\nThis place is also very small. I saw 5-6 two-people tables (2 hidden in the back) and 3 window seats, but if you put a laptop on these table, there'll be no room for the second person.. The bar table for the window seats was also super wobbly, not too work-friendly.

The nitro flight comes with 2 cups of nitro coffee. 1st is original nitro coffee (no sugar and no milk) and the 2nd nitro coffee is tinted with a hint of dairy and a waffle cookie.

I got the deconstructed latte ($7) and my friend got the nitro flight ($7) while the others got cold brews. \u00a0The presentation of both flights were absolutely beautiful and it came with a little wafer cookie! The lovely staff (seriously, everyone that works here is so nice it's almost unbelievable) brought out our drinks and educated us on each component of the experience almost like a wine tasting starting with the espresso, followed by the milk (sweet and frothy), and then finally the final product! I now feel like a true coffee sommelier - which should definitely be a thing if it isn't already. \n\nPlease please come here and try it, if not for the deconstructed latte then for the people working here and the good vibes that this place exudes.

Cold brew coffee is, of course, the hot new trend in the coffee world. Everyone has it, but very few places do it really well: they are either too acidic, or lacking in flavour . The cold brew at CPNYC strikes the perfect balance between taste and acidity, and has a slightly sweet/chocolaty flavor. I can't say enough about it!\n\nThe rest of the coffee is equally good. All of their espresso drinks are great. They have almond milk, and prepare it wonderfully. I haven't had the deconstructed latte, but it sure looks amazing and is very popular. The pastries are always fresh and tasty. And the staff is really nice and fun to talk to. Wifi is fast and free.

It's not the biggest place, but if you can snag one of their 8 seats then it's totally worth it. \n\nDeconstructed Latte ($7): \nServed on a wooden board, you get a shot of espresso, a shot of milk and then the rest of the latte in one glass (AND they give it a design). You also get some water and a wafer cookie to cleanse your palette. The server informed us that there are two ways for going about this - sip sip drink or shot shot drink. I'm not a huge coffee person, so the espresso was not something I'd particularly like to sip on. I will say that it was strong, though! \n\nNitro Flight ($7):\nAlso served on a wooden board, you have two small glasses of their nitro coffee, that wafer biscuit and a tiny pitcher of a cane sugar syrup. \nThis was my first experience with nitro coffee (coffee infused with nitrogen), and I loved it. It goes down a lot smoother than regular coffee. Here, they serve small glass of black nitro coffee and one with a bit more dairy added to it. The one with dairy had hints of cinnamon and chocolate. As I said before, I'm not a huge coffee person. The black coffee, in my opinion, didn't need the daily to be good. \n\nWhile these are great to try, just know that these two menu items are for dine-in only! \n\nBonus: the employees here were so friendly.

By the time we got them, the ice had melted substantially and thus everything was quite watery.\n\nRecommendation to the baristas (who were so nice and really tried to make waiting less painful with their very cheery and calm dispositions): wait on the ice until you are ready to make that drink. It takes a second to fill a cup but 15 minutes to spoil that patient person's beverage.\n\nThat said, the deconstructed options all looked fun and I wish we were able to enjoy them, but with two kids in tow, the finer things in life must wait for weekend visits to grandmas. \u00a0We would return if the luxury of time made that possible, but we'd definitely skip the icy drinks if it looked like a queue preceded us."]

["Kyle C.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Fantastic coffee shop. It's hard to stand out in the ever-expanding NYC coffee scene, but the Coffee Project is really something special. The attention to detail with their coffee is amazing, with a cute little space and an incredibly creative menu. The deconstructed latte and nitro flight make for an interactive and fun coffee experience. It's almost like a little science project, and the baristas are the lecturers that tell you exactly what it is and how to enjoy it. \n\nI decided to go with the simple cold brew, which was smooth and full-bodied with no need for any additives; straight and true. However, the nitro cold brew was my favorite. Served from the tap, the consistency is so unique, with a beer-like foam and a very smooth taste. No bitterness at all, it was excellent! This is the real deal when it comes to coffee. It is a tiny place, so it may be cramped. However, it is totally worth it because the coffee is on another level. Two thumbs up!"]
["Helen P.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "When I saw the photos of the Deconstructed Latte on this Yelp page, I knew I had to visit Coffee Project. My boyfriend and I dropped in on Saturday morning and I ordered the Deconstructed Latte + a raspberry scone while my boyfriend ordered the Nitro-Flight. The coffee shop is very small, so we were lucky to snag a table tucked away in a corner towards the back.\n\nThis place serves the most aesthetically pleasing and fancy-looking latte I have ever sipped on. The espresso shot was strong and sharp. The milk was warm, creamy, and ever-so-slightly sweet. The actual latte was very delicious and probably one of the most enjoyable lattes I've ordered from a coffee shop. \n\nI tried a few sips of my boyfriend's Nitro-Flight. The barista told us that the nitro coffee + milk tastes like ice cream when the cane sugar is added and that the nitro coffee on its own tastes like Guinness beer. She wasn't lying! \n\nThe baristas are so friendly/informative and the delicious coffee is so reasonably priced, I will definitely be coming back to Coffee Project New York."]

As many others note, the nice barista explained the suggested tasting order, flavor notes and origins of each component, and purpose in creating such a menu item: to expose customers to the much avoided espresso shot. \n\nMy espresso was smooth and did accurately hit the flavor notes the barista told me to look out for. She also came back after I was finished to ask for feedback. She clearly cared about my experience there.\n\nHaven't tried others, but would definitely go back when I'm in the area.

It was very creamy and I did not even need to add milk or anything. The nitro version is a dollar more than regular, but it's worth it!!!\n\nWas tempted to get the Nitro+Icecream, next time I guess."]

It's a cute little spot in the East Village, and has a very unique way of showcasing coffee. Their DECONSTRUCTED LATTE is what brought me to the door to begin with, but it's their NITRO BREW that blew me out of the water!\n\nBut let's start with the deconstructed latte: First of all, how amazing is the presentation of this thing?! It looked like a wine flight! So cute and classy, I LOVED IT! Everybody raves about this thing, so I won't go on into too much detail, but it's definitely something you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO try! It's not only delicious, but it's too pretty to not share. ;) \n\nThe nitro brew: Holy moly, I have never tasted anything so delicious in my life! Even if you normally don't drink black coffee (like me!!!), you will LOVE this stuff! It tastes so smooth and creamy, that - trust me - you will NOT be missing the milk or sugar at all. If I could strap this stuff to an IV, I WOULD. Haha!\n\nONE OF THE BEST PARTS: How personable the owner, Sum, is! She not only brings the coffee right to your table, but she thoughtfully explains the \"coffee project\" to you, and is so sweet and inviting. \n\nCHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE VIDEO (TYPE IN \"COFFEE PROJECT NYC\" OR \"SERENA IN NYC\") FOR MY FULL REVIEW: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdxszhxLzak0&amp;s=7e0e1e2105182b5edf193e176bcb06cc7e37c75591e0e8e223432b3ccff6b048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=dxsz\u2026</a>"]

Not only is the coffee great but the owners really care about coffee and even better, they care about their customers caring about coffee. They both made sure to come over individually and chat with us, giving a lengthy description of where the beans came from and the tasting notes.\n\nTheir deconstructed latte is an awesome &amp; original idea. Pricy at $7, but you're getting two lattes basically + a tasty little cookie. Apparently drinking the espresso shot, then the milk, then the latte brings out the flavors of citrus, etc etc. in the coffee. Is this true? Maybe. Maybe it was placebo, but the latte did taste amazing. Next time I'll get the latte alone to see if it makes a difference. But the espresso shot was possibly the best I've had even compared to ones I've had in Italy!! I liked it because it didn't taste at all burnt/bitter like it often is and you could really taste the notes of citrus and whatever the other two flavor profiles were (don't remember anymore).\n\nAlso, I didn't see it on the menu, but they do do pourovers w/ your choice of beans (different from drip coffee)"]

The deconstructed latte also comes with about five minutes info session about the bean, where it came from, etc..\n\nMy ultimate favorite is the nitro coffee, like you know, nitro beer..so good that ordered two.

It was amazing - the coffee was so smooth and I felt almost sad when it was finished. My friend got a mocha and she was it was good as well (but \"basic\" compared to what I got). \n\nThe seating area is limited so keep that in mind if you're trying to come here for a coffee chat or meetup.

["Riah K.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Absolutely love it here!! \n\nI came here on a rainy spring day with a friend and it was just the perfect place/mood/ambience to sip on coffee. The soft, lovely music playing in the cafe and the sound of raindrops hitting the asphalt outside set the scene for a perfect spring afternoon. \n\nOnto the coffee... \nMy friend got the deconstructed latte ($7) and I tried the nitro flight ($7). A bit pricy, but well worth the experience in my opinion. The lady behind the counter (owner of the cafe I think) personally delivered it to our table and thoroughly explained to us what each item was on the plate and how to get the best flavor out of each item. The presentation is so beautiful too! Perfect for that Instagram post! \n\nThe shop is tiny, but it's so cute and homey. I wouldn't say it's a place to stay for a long time since there is limited seating. A couple was rudely occupying two tables when my friend and I came in, so the owner personally asked them to make space for us (such great customer service!).\n\nOverall this place is great for the coffee lover who wants to experience a new way to enjoy coffee. Definitely want to try more things on the menu in my next visit!"]

["Mary P.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Espresso!!!!! Yayyyy!\n\nNot since I was in Europe have I found myself drinking a delicious shot of espresso. And these people know what to do.\n\nIn fact the barista came over to discuss my drinks with me after the fact and talked to me about how difficult it can be to make a good shot. That must be true because I usually get smacked in the face with bitter. Not this time. I took my cold coffee sampler and enjoyed it but the best one was the espresso half and half mix over ice.\n\nThe music here is jazzy and calm which is perfect for this rainy afternoon. I'm just sitting on this slightly uncomfortable wooden stool looking out at the rain on 5th street. Yes it's yet another coffee shop with the industrial wood +metal look but I don't mind, I like the look.\n\nI almost had a deconstructed latte (next on my list) which is a shot of espresso in a thin flute glass next to a cup of milk next to a latte with a palette cleanser. But the cold sampler is probably going to be my preference. Nitro cold brew is just fun, fizzy and playful. The tonic cold brew was very sour, probably good for those who like tonic drinks. And my favorite...the espresso half and half mixed over ice. \n\nAdd in a delicious kouign amann. Happiness!!"]
["Tom B.", "4.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I've heard so much about this place, I had to try it out. I love my coffee and am currently trying to visit a lot of nice coffee places around the city so all the hype made me come here first!\n\nI'd wanted to try this famous three-piece deconstructed latte (also known as Coffee Project #1), so I came here around 10.30am to miss the morning rush. You have to sit in to have this and I was lucky that there were seats available, it's a very small place. I ordered and took a seat. \n\nAfter a few minutes, a server brought it over to me and I have to say at first sight, it does look impressive. The presentation is immaculate with the three glasses lined up; espresso, milk and latte. It also comes with a delicious biscuit and a glass of sparkling water to clean the palate. The server offers to explain everything and gives recommendations on how to enjoy it the most. It's all very interesting and I appreciated the effort the server gave. \n\nOK.... So I understand the concept and it was cool trying all the separate parts but it didn't blow me away if I'm being honest. I don't think its purpose is to make it your daily morning coffee anyway! It's an experience. All parts were nice and the actual latte at the end is creamy and tasty. At $7, it is definitely worth trying once for sure. I think it would be a great option for a first or second date. \n\nSome things which I loved about the place. I stayed here for about 45 minutes reading a book. The place seems very busy and people are always coming and going. There is a cool friendly atmosphere here and everyone seems to know each other. The ambiance is very chill and they have some great music on in the background. They also have a section where there is no phones allowed (they put a sign on the table, have a look at my photos). \n\nOverall, I really did like this place. The actual Coffee Project #1 was nice but I'm not going to say it's a necessity. Definitely try it out however and I still plan to try the Coffee Project #2. Unfortunately, I live in Astoria so I'm never going to go here that regularly but if you're in the area, definitely pop in! A place with a cool vibe, really nice people and most importantly, lovely coffee."]

When I came in, the baristas talked me into trying their deconstructed latte, apparently was featured in Time Out NY, so of course I had to try it. \n\nWhen they brought it out to me, it came on a wooden platter with four individual glasses and a cookie. I was blown away. The first glass is a shot of espresso, followed by a shot of steam milk, and then last a glass of latte. The idea is to drink them in order to really grasp the unique mix of flavor. The cookie adds to the sweetness and the glass of sparkling water is used as a pallet cleanser. I personally was never a fan of espresso shots, but the concept made me enjoy espresso like never before.\n\nBefore i forget, i have to add: one of the main reasons why I gave this place a full 5 stars is not so much of the cool and uniqueness of their coffee, but their awesome staff. Honestly, most welcoming and friendly staff I've ever experienced at a coffee shop...especially for being only my first time. One of the baristas even came over in the middle of trying their new concoction and asked genuinely how I was liking it. You can really see their passion for not only coffee shop, but coffee in general. This aspect made me love this place that much more. \n\nI highly recommend any east village coffee lover to make their way to this place. Its a cool, modern atmosphere with awesome design elements. Their hanging lights are amazing. It's small, but there's enough tables to sit down and even do work. Grab a latte. Or if you're feeling adventurous as i did, try their deconstructed latte."]

Definitely worth getting if you've never tried it before just for a new taste experience. They also have deconstructed lattes which is broken down into three flights - a shot of espresso, a glass of milk, and a full latte... by deconstructing the latte into its two main components and having you drink those first, it allows you to identify the notes of espresso like chocolate and sweetness of milk in the constructed latte.

["Laura O.", "4.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Naturally, we came to Coffee Project New York to try the famed Deconstructed Latte, which sounds like a beverage one would drink while observing a course on Postmodern Feminism or something. Our helpful barista, clearly passionate about her craft, explained the concept, which is actually pretty simple: take a sip of the espresso, sip of the steamed milk, and finally a sip of the two elements combined into a latte, where you'll be able to better discern the distinct flavors. I think it's a unique, fun concept that allowed us to understand each layer of the drink. I thought the espresso was particularly delicious, and even though I'm not a big milk drinker, the milk from Battenkill creamery is pasteurized but made to taste as close to raw milk as possible, and it was easy drinking. I wasn't a huge lover of the latte, though-- I thought it was a bit too milk-heavy. The cookie was a nice touch.\n\nThe service here was extraordinarily friendly, and the barista came by to ask how we liked our drinks.

["Karen C.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "This might be my new favorite cafe in the city! My friend and I were looking for a cafe to hang out at, and the cute decor of this place drew us in. I am so in love with the ambience here - once you walk through the door, you're greeted by lovely jazz music, smiley friendly baristas, and most importantly, the divine smell of coffee and pastries. If you're looking for a cafe to chill at on a lazy day, this place absolutely has the entire package! \n\nWe got there on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30pm, and were surprised to be able to get a table easily. Most people who came in got their coffee to go, maybe because of the time we were there. The cafe got progressively more and more crowded and loud as the afternoon went on, and there was a long line as well as people waiting around for a table by the time it was 2pm. \n\nWe both knew that we were each going to try the deconstructed latte, but were unsure of what food to order. We asked the barista for her recommendations, and she was SO nice and patient with us! She went through every single one of their pastries, described the various options, and gave her suggestions on the most popular ones. We ended up getting the mushroom quiche (best mushroom quiche I've had in NYC - definite must try!) and the blueberry scone. \u00a0\n\nThe deconstructed latte was definitely interesting. It was my first time trying it and wasn't sure what to expect. How it works is this: 3 glasses, the first with an espresso shot, the second with steamed milk, and the third with the actual latte. You're supposed to start with the espresso shot first, then move on to the steamed milk, and lastly, the latte. The barista explained that if you drink it in that particular order, the flavors of the coffee are enhanced. They also give you a waffle biscuit (NOTE: has traces of nuts, so don't have the biscuit if you're allergic) as well as a glass of sparkling water to cleanse your palate between the glasses. Personally, I'm a huge coffee addict and love my coffee bitter, so I really enjoyed the deconstructed latte. However, if you prefer your coffee sweet and like to put sugar or sweetener, you may not enjoy the raw shot of espresso (cup 1) as it was really strong. \n\nOverall, this place is by far super deserving of a 5-star rating. I will definitely be back to try some of their other drinks and pastries!"]
["Alex S.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "This place is such a trendy, new concept place. Myself and 2 friends sat at their bar and all had the nitro coffee on tap. It was so smooth and creamy textured. A must go to coffee joint."]
["Kat G.", "4.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Dropped by with a friend from out of town. We were looking to have some damn good coffee, and we got it. Originally we asked to try their nitro coffee, but they were out that day. Sad, sad life. We both decided to try their deconstructed latte instead, and it was great! I loved the little cookie it came with because I'm a sucker for sweets and coffee. The steamed milk they use is so delicious, I nearly chugged the tiny glass of it. My friend can't have too much dairy, so I gladly had hers. \n\nThe service here is wonderful - when we were standing in front of the cashier slowly trying to decide which coffee to try, the cashier kindly described all the drinks we were curious about and recommended some drinks. Later, when we had finished our coffees and were buzzing from caffeine, the barista stopped by and we chatted about coffee and misugaru for quite a while.\n\nWhenever I'm back in nyc I'll return. You can definitely feel their enthusiasm and love for their craft from the way they make coffee and how they interact with customers."]

Perfect for catching up with friends - but because the place is tiny, I'd probably catch up with 1-2 other friends. I wish there was a place like this in midtown!"]

The place is tiny but staff is very friendly, too bad I discovered the cafe one day before I moved out of NY. I will definitely go back. I couldn't resist having two deconstructed lattes in an hour. It's that good."]

["Steph N.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Coffee Project New York is cute, quaint and charming. The cafe decor is warm and cozy, with limited seating. The owners of the shop are down to earth, friendly and informative. They know their coffee and they know what they are doing. You can tell they genuinely care about the quality of their coffee, the product and their customers satisfaction. We had the deconstructed latte, where presentation, taste and flavor were all so good in a perfect blend of steamed milk and espresso - and the ability to try espresso and milk as standalone's were great. We also had the Affogato, which was DELICIOUS. The vanilla ice cream was amazing with their smooth espresso. I am still thinking about it and cannot wait to go back to have it again."]

They are real experts in coffee and offer also some very yummy alternatives. The music played in the Caf\u00e9, chosen by Sum (the owner), is extraordinary fantastic! ***** highly recommended.\n\nDas Caf\u00e9 ist super, die M\u00e4dels sehr nett, der Caf\u00e9 lecker und die Musik grandios."]

["Karolina A.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I love this place! Great service and nice atmosphere. I'm not a coffee drinker so I had the hot chocolate and it was the best I've had in NYC so far (and I think it'll be hard to beat). It was rich and creamy and just a delight to drink. Great place to work as well. Will definitely come back!"]

["Jenny S.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I loved the deconstructed latte. I didn't expect it to play such a large role in the flavors. And I had the best canele I've ever had there. They said it takes 20 hours to make!"]
["Willa T.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Even though I live on the block, it took me a while to come in because I am not a coffee drinker. The two women who run the place are incredibly friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere of the coffee shop is as well-- it is warm and light inside. And even though I can't speak for the coffee, they make an incredible chai latt\u00e9! \n\nI will most definitely become a regular!"]
["Priscilla P.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "If you are looking for a good cup of coffee, look no further! Awesome combination of music, caffeine, and company! I had the Project 1, the deconstruct latte. First step, espresso. I could taste the honey and nutty flavor. Second, milk. Smooth to the tongue. Third, the latte. The best thing I have ever had! No sugar needed at all!"]
["Nick O.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "The deconstruction of the latte is unique, aesthetically pleasing, and tastes exquisite! If you are looking for a unique experience in coffee that also tastes wonderful then do yourself a favor and come here! You won't regret it!"]
["Jenny K.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "nitro flight is a must! i preferred the glass with some dairy in it. naturally sweet dairy. \n\nthe cafe is a great spot to do some light work (planning/reading), but even writing papers is fine if you come on weekday mornings. the baristas are so freaking nice and tries to remember their regulars."]
["Elyn K.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "A new cafe in the neighborhood! Customers are always greeted with wide smiles and warm greetings by the 2 nice owners/barista. The coffee was impeccable! I've not been disappointed by any of the items from the menu so far. They boast a wide array of speciality coffee, such as nitro coffee and coffee tonic. \u00a0Those were definite must tries! All in all, great service, ambience and most importantly, great coffee!"]

["Eden J.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "This coffee shop has a great atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and the coffee is delicious! I recommend the deconstructed latte or the nitro flight (both are dine-in only). You might have to wait a bit for a table since it's small but it's well worth it."]
["Maillards R.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Fantastic coffee and lovely owners intensely dedicated to their craft. I lament sharing this with others as the environment is warm and tranquil but small, and certainly won't benefit locals once the word gets out. In any event, here it is for the world to see. Highly recommended!"]
["Ki L.", "4.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "My order was the ice cream with espresso. Although at first sight it appears to be small, it's actually perfect! The concept is simple with the sweetness from the vanilla ice cream and the smooth bitter richness of the espresso. The balance of the two dances through my palette. For this visit, I didn't get a napkin though. Otherwise it would have been a perfect 5 stars!"]

["Jason C.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I am a huge coffee drinker and normally always order Americano, the owners recommended the Cold Brew. It reminded me of Kona coffee, absolutely delicious with the smoothest after taste of any coffee I have ever had. This place is a must for coffee aficionados. Coffee Project is now my favorite coffee place!"]
