["Kathryn T.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "This is it. This is my favorite coffee place in the world. It's a bougie, slightly hipster place but if you want an incredible, unique coffee experience go to Coffee Project New York.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n1. THE HAPPY DRINK IS EVERYTHING. I actually feel happier after I order it. It's delicious, creamy, refreshing, and the coffee is well done. You have to get it. No matter what the weather, this is the drink to get.\n2. The deconstructed latte is worth a try at least once. So much thought is put into it and the flavor profiles are really apparent.\n3. Service is top notch. Everyone is friendly and coffee loving.\n4. This is more of a sit down and enjoy your coffee and the vibes place. But you can take coffee to go.\n5. The coffee is absolutely worth the higher price tag.\n\nCPNW is the number one spot for coffee. Whether you're visiting NYC or a local, you absolutely must come here. And you will come back."]
["Jonathan C.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I'm not a coffee connoisseur, I normally drink tea but this place may have convinced me to switch. \n\nGot the nitro flight and the nitro float to fuel an intense afternoon of paper writing. The nitro flight was as smooth and as complex as promised. \n\nThe nitro float was also kind of interesting but probably more of a summer thing. \n\nThe ambiance here is also nice and on weekdays not too crowded. Good for people watching."]
["Alina M.", "4.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "After seeing so many pictures of the deconstructed latte of course I had to try it and photograph it for myself! It was definitely an interesting experience and I really enjoyed it. If you don't like coffee or are particularly averse to the bitterness, this probably isn't for you. However, if you are an addict such as myself, it's worth a try. Most things on the menu are pretty pricey so for me personally, I don't think I would make a habit out of coming there. There was a decent variety of desserts and they had some vegan and gluten-free options for those interested in that.\n\nThe place itself is really small and there isn't much place to sit. Something that I liked is that most of the tables have a sign basically states that laptops and tablets are not allowed and to enjoy your coffee and the conversation. You don't see a lot of that these days because most coffee shops have become places for people to do their work so it was a welcome sight."]
["Marygrace A.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "Such an adorable little adventure!\nI arrived with a friend on a Saturday afternoon, around 1pm. There are only 3 tables &amp; a bar by the window (plus 1 table in the back), so seating is limited. Most people got their drinks to go, but we wanted to try the famous Deconstructed latte ($7) &amp; the Nitro coffee flight ($5).\n\nOrdering was super fast &amp; the cashier was very friendly. We took a seat in the front of the shop (no laptops are allowed in this area) and waited only a few minutes for our order.\n\nAn awesome barista brought our coffee &amp; asked if she could explain each one. We listened as she shared her advice on how to drink the deconstructed latte: Start from left to right, beginning with the espresso, then the foamed milk, and finally, the latte itself. The seltzer is the palette cleanser to be consumed at the beginning and end.\n\nIt was super tasty and fun to enjoy the coffee in this way.\n\nThe nitro flight came with a standard cold brew, and another with cream and sugar. Both were good, but I thought the black cold brew was flat and watery. My friend enjoyed it, though.\n\nBoth sets come with a pizzelle (Italian waffle wafer) which is a nice addition.\n\nA note about sugar: The latte flight does not include sugar &amp; the baristas are purists, so they don't offer it to you. Instead, you can ask for some agave syrup if you need it. The nitro flight does come with a small creamer of sugar syrup, but I was told by the barista that I won't need it. I supposed that suggestion could be perceived as off-putting, but it didn't bother me."]

The options are great: nitro cold brew, deconstructed latte, affogato, and coffee floats! \n\nI love going to places that are passionate about coffee and \u00a0all the little details that go into customer choice, service, and atmosphere. Haven't been to a place like this since Slate Coffee\n in Seattle!"]
["Kathy V.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I love the concept of this place. Definitely try their infamous latte flight. I was pretty out of it in the morning and once I had their espresso, I was alive and energetic again. They go over it for you once you receive it, but go left to right. Starting with the espresso shot, chased with the milk, and finishing it with the latte. Very tasty and comforting!"]

I will trek here today all the way from Queens just for their iced latte despite the fact that I need to be near Madison Square Garden. It's that good. \n\nI asked why it was so good, granted, I've tried thousands of latte's in my 27 years of life and the barista explained that there is honey and chocolate in their bean. #Heaven. #Sold. Ended up buying a second cup to go. \n\nMy friend tried the deconstructed latte and he very much enjoyed the experience and the flavor. I'll try it myself another time. \n\nIf you are a coffee lover, you will appreciate this place. I promise."]
["Shaji K.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "You have to believe the hype. Came in here expecting some over priced pretentious coffee place with okay food and snooty service. Couldn't be more wrong and gladly so.\n\nEarly Saturday morning and surprisingly only two other people at shop. Interior includes a few tables before the counter and a few stools along the window. Tables are reserved for non-laptop users, which is nice to see (considering it's a small shop). Lady behind the counter is super nice - happily described the pastry items available and the coffee served. Settled on the Deconstructed Latte ($7), and a Raspberry Scone ($4). First off, the scone is amazing. Was easily able to cut into it with a butter knife, soft on the inside with a big fruit flavor.\n\nOnto the main event - the latte came out a few minutes later on the famous platter. Counter lady goes through the process on how to drink it: seltzer water, shot of espresso, then the steamed milk, then the latte, then the cookie, then the water again. Coffee is certainly strong, and you can taste the flavors of the beans. If I had any semblance of a palette, probably would have enjoyed it even more.\n\nI think what really makes a good coffee shop is the environment and the people working there. Aside from the expensive latte they have your basics at the right cost and other interesting drinks to boot. If I lived closer, would easily be my morning coffee stop."]
["Sherry D.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I have made my way back here to try that deconstructed latte and that is one worthy drink to have when you feel like treating yourself (which you should always find time to do if you aren't already). It's $7 which is definitely pricey for coffee, but it's in the experience of drinking it.\n\nThis place deserves all the stars because the service is also just the loveliest I've ever had. It was my first time trying the deconstructed latte and one of the workers came over and described the process of consuming to fully enjoy the drink in this project house. The espresso and milk was on point and was such a great way to introduce the latte itself. I was thoroughly impressed and my coffee companion was definitely envious. I shared of course! The table next to ours even asked how it was. Just get it. Perfect drink to have a nice conversation over."]

I think it was like $4.75. \u00a0Wow, prices went up in NYC in the past year. \u00a0Most other places are $3.50-4.00 for cold brew. \u00a0Anyways, am I sounding cheap?! Yep, thats not a very New York thing of me to do! lol\n\nStaff were nice, especially at the counter. \u00a0Coffee guy smiled but didn't say much even when I tried chatting several times, I think he might want to get chattier. \u00a0Always annoyed at NY coffee places where the staff spend all their time talking to each other but never the customers. \u00a0I don't bite!!!! :-)\n\nYou have to ask for the loyalty card - otherwise they don't offer.\n\nI'll be coming back several times! \u00a0Great addition to the hood, hope they can stay awhile!!!"]

["Jolene J.", "4.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "New Yorkers are spoiled with good coffee. At this point, I'm inclined to think that it's probably more difficult to find a hip cafe that serves horrible coffee rather than one that serves a solid cup. And yep, I really just bumped up (slightly) this place because of its awesome soundtrack and cute interior..\n\nPer many Yelpers' recommendation, I tried the deconstructed latte, which I'd probably give 3.5 stars on its own.. the latte was solid, the frothy milk sweet and smooth, but the espresso shot tasted a bit acidic.. may be it's the bean, may be I'm still just a baby and can't seem to appreciate espresso shots yet? (the latte was solid, just the espresso shot a bit too acidic for my taste) I'm not sure, but I was a bit disappointed despite the perfect latte and the ever so helpful barista who patiently explained how to best enjoy this process.\n\nThis place is also very small. I saw 5-6 two-people tables (2 hidden in the back) and 3 window seats, but if you put a laptop on these table, there'll be no room for the second person.. The bar table for the window seats was also super wobbly, not too work-friendly. Either way, wouldn't recommend coming here to work because of how small and seemingly popular this place is (in the span of ~30 minutes that I was there, 2 groups ended up leaving without ordering anything because the seating was full)\n\nWould I come back? Not unless I'm in the neighborhood which is pretty rare, or I'm with a friend who enjoys instagramming cute photos as much as I d."]

Finally made it. If you're looking for something different in coffee or you'd rather spend your coffee $ on one you most likely won't make at home, this is definitely the spot to check out. Their unique nitro coffee has this smooth taste that's interesting. Like the guy at the counter explained to me - it's a coffee version of Guinness. Coffee's rich and creamy, and has foamy head like beer."]
["Cynthia Z.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "First timer. Super friendly staff ! we ordered the deconstructed latte ($7) and nitro flight ($7). Not your average type of latte as you can tell by the name \"deconstructed\" comes with an espresso shot, steamed milk, latte, sprinkling water and a waffle cookie. The staff gives you 3 steps: to start with the espresso shot then the steamed milk and last the latte. The nitro flight comes with 2 cups of nitro coffee. 1st is original nitro coffee (no sugar and no milk) and the 2nd nitro coffee is tinted with a hint of dairy and a waffle cookie. Staff recommends drinking the nitro coffee as is without adding any sugar. Because my 1st cup of nitro coffee came out with a bit to much foam the staff went ahead and offered me an extra cup."]

This had been sitting in my bookmarks for months, and after an early morning of volunteering nearby, I felt I deserved a $7 deconstructed latte (but hey- you can't put a price on Instagram likes, right?).

Kudos all around."]

Both were surprising, with a very sophisticated presentation (you can feel that they are luring the hipster customers here) but not exceptional in taste. \n\nAlso, the owners didn't offer any sugar - I asked for it, they put one small spoon of agave syrup in my coffee and told me it would be sweet enough like that. I welcome their opinion but I am 25 and I kinda know how I like my coffee, so I didn't like the judgmental tone here."]

I got the deconstructed latte ($7) and my friend got the nitro flight ($7) while the others got cold brews. \u00a0The presentation of both flights were absolutely beautiful and it came with a little wafer cookie! The lovely staff (seriously, everyone that works here is so nice it's almost unbelievable) brought out our drinks and educated us on each component of the experience almost like a wine tasting starting with the espresso, followed by the milk (sweet and frothy), and then finally the final product! I now feel like a true coffee sommelier - which should definitely be a thing if it isn't already. \n\nPlease please come here and try it, if not for the deconstructed latte then for the people working here and the good vibes that this place exudes.

["Brian S.", "5.0", "coffee-project-new-york-new-york", "I've been to a lot of coffee shops around the world, and this is the BEST, and I mean the ABSOLUTE BEST I've ever had. \n\nTo begin with, their cold brew is phenomenal! Cold brew coffee is, of course, the hot new trend in the coffee world. Everyone has it, but very few places do it really well: they are either too acidic, or lacking in flavour . The cold brew at CPNYC strikes the perfect balance between taste and acidity, and has a slightly sweet/chocolaty flavor. I can't say enough about it!\n\nThe rest of the coffee is equally good. All of their espresso drinks are great. They have almond milk, and prepare it wonderfully. I haven't had the deconstructed latte, but it sure looks amazing and is very popular. The pastries are always fresh and tasty. And the staff is really nice and fun to talk to. Wifi is fast and free. The F, R, and 4/5/6 trains are only a 5 minute walk away. \n\nWhy aren't you here yet?!"]
