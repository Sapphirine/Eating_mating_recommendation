Matcha is super trendy this year as many matcha shops emerged in the city, but Matcha Wabi is certainly my favorite now. Upon entering the small shop, it's all about matcha. The air is full of matcha and butter aroma from the baked cookies; the counter and shelf behind the bar are all painted in matcha green; and the owner is greeting me with a welcoming smile. Not only offering extensive choices of matcha drinks, wabi also serves all kinds of home-made matcha snacks! I ordered matcha latte for my first visit, that came with a lovely smile on the latte (see the pic!!!) Just one sip, oh man, this is heaven. Matcha goes really well with full fat milk. The milk aroma balances the bitterness of matcha, leaving a nice matcha aroma blended with milk aroma. The drink is well balanced, foamy, consistent, and lightly sweetened. I nibbled the 16oz cup in 5mins. Definitely need to get the largest size next time!\n\nBe aware the space is very limited, only 2 benches available (one inside and on outside); and, it's CASH only.

Its a quaint little spot and they sell cute little Japanese trinkets next to the pastries. \n\nIts pretty cool to stay inside when its not so packed because you can really see them making everything and its clear that they don't mess around with their matcha. You can see them grind it into a powder and mix it into all of the drinks and its process that's pretty cool to watch.\n\nS E R V I C E\n+ The two girls working were very helpful! My friend and I were pretty indecisive about what we wanted so they were patient with us and gave us some great recommendations on food and drinks (especially since we were first timers). \n\nF O O D &amp; D R I N K\n+ The Wabi Matcha latte (iced) lightly sweetened ($5). One of the most notable things about this place is that everything isn't too sweet, which is something that I LOVE. Their drinks are lightly sweetened (NOTHING like the Starbucks green tea latte) and you can really taste the nuttiness and the potency of the green tea. The iced drink was thicker than most because of the green tea powder and I absolutely loved it. So. Good. \n\n+ The Rice Flour Steam Mochi Matcha Red Bean pastry ($2.50). Now this one is a huge plus for me!! I love red bean, matcha AND mochi so having all those things in one pastry was home run for me. I loved the chewy texture and how it wasn't overpoweringly sweet. I didn't eat breakfast prior to coming here and I ate one of these and felt satisfied despite the size. \n\n+ Matcha chocolate scone ($3 &amp; a newer treat). This pastry was tasty and definitely better when warm, there are also raisins in it so it gives it a little extra sweetness and texture.\n\nALL IN ALL...\nThis place is my new favorite matcha spot :) The ingredients are high quality and you can tell everything is very fresh. I love the hole in the wall vibe and all of the girls working were sweet.

The baristas were very knowledgable and friendly as well. The only downside is the size... They only have a single bench that fits two people at most, which makes it more of a grab-n-go caf\u00e9.

["K.K W.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "I'm gonna start my first Yelp review with 5 stars~ Ooh lala~!!\n\nThis little tiny to-go matcha cafe definitely is a hidden gem, a shop that you only wanna keep it yourself and your bestie, I really don't wanna let those crowds from East Village to overwhelm this cozy cafe.\n\nI got the vegan matcha latte(soy milk), which I would say it was by far the best to-go matcha latte that I've tried in NY. Their matcha barista was so friendly that she even let me to add the syrup by myself since I am kinda picky about the sweetness of the matcha latte. After my first sip, I'd decided that I will try to come every time that I come to East Village. The matcha latte is smooth, and has a strong matcha taste. Their matcha is authentic, you can even smell the unique refreshing sent of matcha as the barista making the drink, which I enjoy it a lot. \n\nAnyway, Matcha Cafe Wabi deserves some encouragement and my 5 starts, even tho deep down my heart I just wanna keep it to myself. Hahaaaahaaaa"]
["Chiara C.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "The most amazing matcha in the East Village. Maybe in New York City? I do not know if I have the creds to say that yet since I am new to the city. But walking around this neighborhood I stumbled into this cute hole in the wall cafe, as matcha obsessed as I am I could not resist the temptation, and I was very much rewarded. \n\nI love matcha anything, particularly matcha green tea lattes, so I have tried a couple around the city. I feel like there are usually one of two kinds, the super sugary milky how-much-matcha-is-even-in-this (probably more sugar than matcha powder) lattes, a-la-Starbucks, or the more authentic, less sugary, but somehow lacking that deep taste you are looking for type of matcha latte. The matcha latte at Matcha Cafe Wabi is neither of those two. It leans towards the second type--in that it feels more authentic and not sugary--but yet also has a deep taste, and I am probably not describing this very well but you can feel in the back of your mouth the same taste you get when drinking a high quality green tea. \n\nIn short, an AMAZING matcha latte. They also have matcha mixed with water if you're looking for a healthier option. Each time I get a drink here I am always thinking about when I can come back. The cashier is also very friendly and nice. \n\nThey also have other matcha treats, such as matcha red bean mochi, matcha madeleines, matcha cookies, etc.! Cash only. They have a card that every 16 drinks you get a free drink. So worth it."]

The shop is cute and small and offers a bunch of little treats you can enjoy along side your drink. The real star though is the matcha stuff. So rich yet not overpowering in match flavor.\n\nWhy not 5 stars? I'd say the drink could be improved by being just a little hotter upon delivery. I'd prefer too hot than luke warm because then you have a way of enjoying your drink at the temperature you prefer. Also, the desserts are on the pricey side but, hey, the shop is just so cute."]

However, \u00a0my friend's passion kept us stick with it. We finally arrived around 6:30 pm and once we stepped in this tiny cafe, I suddenly felt lucky that we eventually got there. \n\nThe cafe is small, not much space, but a very welcomed and exquisite ambiance. My friend and I ordered two cups of hot sakura matcha latte, sakura rice ball, sakura steamed mochi, and matcha steamed mochi (yes, we wanted all its spring's special items). What I would say is, the sakura matcha latte is a must-try for this season. Very lovely looking and delicious tasting, not hot and warm enough for this cool weather. The sakura rice ball is just a simple salty tasting rice ball, and both steamed mochi are just good for us, not too sweet, not really outstanding, but worth to try for snack. \n\nI'm definitely willing to go back to try out other items on the menu, and highly recommend this place to my friends who are matcha fans."]

I was a bit skeptical of a place with 5 stars and only 100 reviews... but I have seen the light.\n\nThe first thing is a LOT of dessert places have one dollar sign for desserts that are about $7-8. I would consider this two dollar signs. This place should deserve a half of a dollar sign given that you can get a single scoop ice cream in a matcha covered oreo cone for only $3.25 (yes - TAX INCLUDED). Even if this was some cheap ice cream that they got out of a grocery store pint and put it on the cone I feel like it'd be worth more in the city.\n\nWe tried the hojicha and black sesame ice cream. I have tried so many green tea desserts my friend and I opted for the black sesame. This was DELICIOUS. One of the best black sesame ice creams I have had. They apparently get it from il laboratorio and I think I'll check it out just because the black sesame was so good.

I shamelessly did a mini photo shoot with my matcha latte at the counter. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and described how they make the lattes here. They use heavy cream, which is why it tastes thicker and richer than most lattes. To be honest, I shy away from heavy dairy products (the remnants of lactose intolerance in my ancestors, perhaps), but I will not shy away from buying another latte if only for the art. Exquisite. \n\nThey also have non-dairy bases like soy milk, so there's a cuppa for everyone.

["Ashley F.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Authentic cute little Japanese cafe \u00a0very yummy drinks. Came here twice \u00a0First time I came they ran out of the Sakura matcha \u00a0very disappointed but settled for strawberry matcha which was very good. Such a good combo \u00a0second time I had the black sesame drink and the white chocolate matcha. Both were good, but you should not mix them.."]

["Mary P.", "4.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Tiny cafe with cash only purchases catered to the matcha and black sesame loving crowd. \"Matcha to-go\" hangs on the awning outside. There is one bench to sit and await your matcha experience. Not a place to bring a crowd.\n\nThe cafe itself is painted in green hues which give an earthy vibe in combination with the exposed brick wall. There is a lot of space in the back of the tea making area that is only for the staff that they could have utilized to make the cafe bigger.\n\nThe classic matcha latte made with heavy cream is delicious. At first it was a bit bitter but the flavors blend in a few sips. Also got a steamed bun (rice cake) that was delicious and a rice Krispy treat that was a bit too dry for my taste.\n\nI would give this place 5 stars for celebrating my love of matcha but it could be bigger (utilize your space it's NYC!) and there needs to be more snackage."]

["Brittany K.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "It's a small cute cafe that makes a variety of matcha flavored drinks and sweets. \u00a0I got the seasonal ichigo matcha that has strawberries and matcha (by the time I thought of taking a picture it was already in my stomache oops) and Iya, the person who made my drink was the sweetest ever(shutup I don't have a crush) and I will definitely be coming back to try the other drinks yuum."]

["James S.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Amazing! It's very difficult to find matcha at coffee shops, so it was refreshing to see a place that specializes in nothing but the healthy drink. The shop itself is very small but the decor suits the place well. It is CASH ONLY, just a warning."]

["Sean C.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Matcha Cafe Wabi is cute, efficient, willing to help out and packed with Japanese goodness. Just like this review.\n\nIf this is your first time, just have a temperature appropriate to season matcha latte ($4 - $5) and possibly some goma ice cream ($3) if you're feeling gluttonous. It will be worth coming here out of the way from that other matcha cafe near the Christopher Street 1.\n\nEfficient."]
["Erica Y.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Really delicious, strong Matcha latte. \u00a0They have a nice selection of Matcha, tea, and coffee drinks, as well as some nice treats on the side. \u00a0Service is great, too. \u00a0Hope to return soon!"]
["Chad D.", "4.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "First time here and loved it. Interesting decor and not very good curb appeal from the outside. But the inside is warm and welcoming but very small and quaint. Small bench on inside and small bench on outside. Healthy and tasty. Great place when you are on the go."]
["Hilary W.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Found out about this place by happenstance on Yelp. It's great. Very zen inside, small take out place. I had the matcha iced latte. Delicious, though next time I will ask for less ice ( too much, and it gives you less drink). Can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu."]
["Diana T.", "4.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "I love this cozy little nook dedicated to matcha. I really enjoy the matcha latte with the almond milk. I'd like to see more onigiri choices or perhaps a little more baked goods but, I look forward to matcha on the weekend!"]

["Rhee A.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Great new little matcha bar tucked away near 4th and Av. B. They have a small but nicely curated menu of drinks, many of which can be made hot or cold. In addition to the matcha and matcha latte, they offer (among others) genmaicha, hojicha, yuzu black tea, and another black sesame drink. Although they only have one type of matcha powder (from Kyoto), it was delicious and worth the side trip.\n\nThe lady at the counter was also great to talk to and I'm excited to see how this place takes off in the coming weeks/months!"]
["Emine A.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "One of my absolute favorite places in East village. Not only are the teas/coffees delicious, the treats absolutely delicious (matcha cookies are my favorite!) but the employees are delightfully sweet. Unless they're super swamped, they have large smiles on their faces but even when the place is packed (it's a really small space, one bank inside one outside) they're really helpful."]
["Gary G.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Everything about this place is lovely. The owner and her staff are beyond courteous, and they make each drink with exceptional care and skill. \n\nThe matcha latte is of course their signature drink, and it is delicious! They also make an amazing hot chocolate, which basically got my girlfriend and me through the winter. \n\nThey have lots of interesting traditional Japanese sweets as well, so be adventurous and try one!"]

["Tina S.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "This place is great! The matcha lattes are delicious and seem higher quality than ones I've had elsewhere in the neighborhood for about the same price. Service is excellent and they have some tasty Japanese treats and ice cream, too. Cash only. No real seating, just a bench, but Tompkins is near by, so you can watch some dogs while you sip your tea."]
["Tyler C.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "This is a really great tiny Japanese coffee and tea shop. It's very small, \u00a0so there is no seating, but it is absolutely charming and amazing. It is definitely worth checking out!"]
["Nisa F.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "I love the hot matcha! Yes, it is a very small place and you have place to sit, but the tea is very good, and you get to learn a little bit more about the tea there"]
["Sandy R.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Lovely and cozy spot with amazing matcha lattes. I really like their black sesame latte too. Definitely not a spot where you'd want to plan to meet someone (due to the limited seating), but if you're in the neighbourhood it's definitely worth grabbing a drink to go. So good!"]
["Emmanuella Z.", "4.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Matcha Cafe Wabi is a cute little cafe located in the LES of Manhattan. Obviously, they serve everything matcha, hence the name. It's a small spot with a fitting green awning and limited seats. If you come here, know there's not really many places to sit, and the cafe might be full. However, the menu is worth the trip over there. They have pretty much matcha anything. Last time I was there, they had a chestnut matcha latte type of drink. I was tempted to get this one but since this was my first time there, I settled with the classic matcha latte. It didn't take that long to be prepared. When I got my latte, it was presented with a cute little flower designed with powdered matcha on the top! It looked really cute. I went and sat on the bench outside to drink it. The matcha was really good and was very bitter. I think that you have to ask for it to be sweetened here since this place is authentic. Matcha is not usually sweetened and this was really good but next time I think I would ask for sweetener. The service was prompt and friendly and I think I will come back here to try the other drinks on the menu!"]
["Charles F.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Absolutely fantastic and one of a kind in the city! Genuine delicious matcha that brought us right back to Japan. It's a lovely quick grab-n-go place not far from Tompkins Square Park, perfect place for a nice matcha latte."]
["Inna S.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Great selection of matcha drinks (including ice cream) and matcha pastries! The matcha is really tasty and the staff is so friendly and welcoming.

["Kate M.", "4.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "This is a nice new addition to Alphabet City's 'tea scene.' Staff is very friendly and it opens early (7 am on weekdays, so you can stop in on your way to work). I prefer the matcha lattes from Physical Graffitea (hence 4 stars and not 5) as they are a little creamier but the lattes from Matcha Cafe Wabi are still very good! Warning: cash only!"]

["Todd L.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Full disclosure: I go to and love Pirka Salon next door with Ken who also owns this place too. But the tea is great and I'm also happy with the matcha from here. I'm hardly a matcha expert but it is the best place I've been too."]
["Tiffany M.", "5.0", "matcha-cafe-wabi-new-york", "Love this matcha place!! Came here for the first time today and ordered an iced vegan matcha latte (with almond milk). Normally I prefer hot drinks to iced, but it was especially hot outside today, so I opted for the iced. They use a blender to whip air into the drink and serve it on ice. Note that it is cash only. Comparable in quality to chalait on Christopher, but there is no seating except for a small bench inside and a small bench outside."]
